# how to get repo to work

1. clone the repo into the default ../apps/myApps folder in your openFrameworks source folder 

2. load the project into generator and add the addons ofxImGui and ofxOpenCv (if not there already)

3. Update the project, and it should load correctly.

** if it doesn't work, yell at me and I'll fix it.
